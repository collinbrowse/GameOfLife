This is a project that I performed while studying abroad at the University of Otago in New Zealand. My Artificial Intelligence class turned out to be my favorite class while I was abroad because of the projects we got to do. This one is called the Game of Life. 

On a simulated 2D board creatures, monsters, mushrooms and strawberries are all placed down. Creatures and monsters have the ability to move around the board. The goal for each generation is for the creatures to survive that generation. A creature won't survive if it get's eaten by a monster, if it eats a mushroom (which kills it) or it uses up all of its health. But a creature can gain health and stay alive by eating strawberries. 

From generation to generation a creature learns what are the better actions to take and what are the worse actions to take using a genetic algorithm. Chromosomes from some of the smartest parents are passed down to the creatures of the next generation. That way creatures learn and evolve so that they can survive better than the previous generation. And that is the Game of Life. 

I used Java and did the graphics in Swing. I used Intellij as my IDE.
